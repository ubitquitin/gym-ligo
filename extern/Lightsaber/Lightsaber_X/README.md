# Controls simulation
This project aims to create a time-domain simulation of the control system of gravitational-wave detectors. It currently has the following components:

1) Noise from suspension platforms, suspension damping loops, sensors, laser-power fluctuations

2) The time-domain model is constructed for the mirror pitch degree of freedom and cavity-beam orientation

3) The readout of the pitch motions of the mirrors can be in arbitrary basis.

4) Linear controllers can be defined in z, p, k format


## Project ideas:
* Test nonlinear feedback control such as reinforcement learning
